Question 1:
CAN data is sent over a two-wire bus which means that it is very simple for different
electronics (or ECU in vehicles) to communicate with each other. This simple mechanism 
also allows CAN to use basically any form of wire USB and ethernet. The encoding of
CAN also uses a high-low differential wiring system which makes it very simple
on an embedded level to understand. 

CAN also has high-speed standard (ISO 11898-2) which allows for high speed encoding
or a fault-tolerant (low speed) mode for reliability by using both wires independently
to encode the same data. However this is slower as instead of measuing the difference of
two wires, the wire has to fluctuate voltage leading to a slower bitrate. 

From a data point of view, the data is very compact and can be packed as dense
as possible as required by the user. This allows it to run on very low memory 
embedded systems and store data quickly with near zero over-head time. 

In essence, CAN is great because it is simple, reliable, and straight forward
in its method.
